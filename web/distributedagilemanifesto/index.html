        <h2>What is the Distributed Agile Manifesto?</h2>
        <p class="lead">It is supposed to be kinda like the <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org">agile manifesto</a>, which we find very cool. However, we want to focus on the fundamentals for successfully developing software in distributed agile teams.</p>

      <div class="grid-1-3">
        <h2>Ok... where is the manifesto?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Sorry, there is nothing yet. This initiative has just been announced (today is October 18th, 2013). We are still gathering people to work on it. The first version of the manifesto, however, is expected to be released by November.</p>

        <h2>Awesome! Can I help?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Yeah! We are looking for collaborators who can share their experiences and help us shape the future of software development. Please subscribe to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distributed-agile">distributed-agile@googlegroups.com</a>, introduce yourself and let's do it together!</p>

      <h2>BTW, who are you?</h2>
      <p class="lead">Oh, thanks for asking... my name is <a href="mailto:carlosgsouza@gmail.com">Carlos</a> and I am an agile enthusiast. I have been a Scrum Master of a distributed team for the past couple years. Recently I realized how difficult it was for us to make it work and how much we can share with other people facing challenges similar to ours. If you want to know more about me, please visit my <a href="http://br.linkedin.com/in/carlosgsouza/">linked.in page</a>.</p>

      <h2>Is there anything else you want to say?</h2>
      <p class="lead">Please check my other initiative, the <a href="http://www.xdprogramming.org">x d programming</a> process.</p>
