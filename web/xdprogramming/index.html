        <h2>What is x d programming?</h2>
        <p class="lead">x d programming is an agile development process designed for eXtremely Distributed teams, which may be spread across several areas and time zones.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1-3">
        <h2>Why another process?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Although popular agile development processes, such as Scrum or XP, can work very well in these scenarios, they require a lot of customization and expertise. Our goal is to offer a simple starting point, making it clear what challenges extremely distributed teams will face and how they can succeed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1-3 last">
        <h2>Ok... where is the process?</h2>
        <p class="lead">Sorry, there is nothing yet. This initiative has just been announced (today is October 18th, 2013). We are still gathering people to work on it. The first version of the process, however, is expected to be released by November.</p>

      <h2>Awesome! Can I help?</h2>
      <p class="lead">Yeah! We are looking for collaborators who can share their experiences and help us shape the future of software development. Please subscribe to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/distributed-agile">distributed-agile@googlegroups.com</a>, introduce yourself and let's do it together!</p>

      <h2>BTW, who are you?</h2>
      <p class="lead">Oh, thanks for asking... my name is <a href="mailto:carlosgsouza@gmail.com">Carlos</a> and I am an agile enthusiast. I have been a Scrum Master of a distributed team for the past couple years. Recently I realized how difficult it was for us to make it work and how much we can share with other people facing challenges similar to ours.
